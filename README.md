# Deep Learning and Machine Learning for Stock predictions
## Stock for Deep Learning and Machine Learning

Description: This is for studying, researching, and analyzing stock in deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML). Predicting Stock with Machine Learning or Deep Learning with different types of algorithm. Experimental in stock data and see how it works and why it work or does not work that way.

&#x1F53B; Do not use this code for investing or trading in the stock market. However, if you are interest in the stock market, you should read :books: books that relate to stock market, investment, or finance. On the other hand, if you into quant or machine learning, read books about &#x1F4D8; machine trading, algorithmic trading, and quantitative trading. You should read &#x1F4D7; about Machine Learning and Deep Learning to understand the concept, theory, and the mathematics. On the other hand, you should read academic paper and do research online about machine learning and deep learning on :computer:
